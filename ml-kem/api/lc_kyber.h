 *
 * * lc_kyber.h: This API is the generic API allowing the caller to select
 *   which Kyber type (Kyber 1024, 768 or 512) are to be used. The selection is
 *   made either with the flag specified during key generation or by matching
 *   the size of the imported data with the different lc_kyber_*_load API calls.
 *   All remaining APIs take the information about the Kyber type from the
 *   provided input data.
 *
 *   This header file only provides wrapper functions which selectively call
 *   the API provided with the header files below.
 *
 * * lc_kyber_1024.h: Direct access to Kyber 1024.
 *
 * * lc_kyber_768.h: Direct access to Kyber 768.
