	 * branching is used to have time-invariant code. This solution
	 * below also shall ensure that the compiler cannot optimize this code
	 * such that it brings back the branching.
	 *
	 * An exploit of the timing channel that would be present with a
	 * branching operation is available at
	 * https://github.com/antoonpurnal/clangover which reportedly
	 * needs <10 minutes for ML-KEM 512 key recovery. More details about
	 * the exploit is given in https://pqshield.com/pqshield-plugs-timing-leaks-in-kyber-ml-kem-to-improve-pqc-implementation-maturity/
	 *
	 * (mask ^ opt_blocker) can be any value at run-time to the compiler,
	 * making it impossible to skip the computation (except the compiler
	 * would care to create a branch for opt_blocker to be either
	 * 0 or -1, which would be extremely unlikely). Yet the volatile
	 * variable has to be loaded only once at the beginning of the function
	 * call.
